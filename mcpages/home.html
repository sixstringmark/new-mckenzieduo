    <p>The McKenzie Duo, one of the Chicago area's finest flute and guitar duos, is the musical
        partnership of husband and wife team of flutist Sue McKenzie and guitarist Mark McKenzie. We have been
        performing
        together for over ten years, for weddings ceremonies, banquets, dedications, memorial services, as well as for
        concert
        performances.

    We draw from diverse musical backgrounds, including
    classical, popular, jazz, traditional and ethnic styles.
    The warm and versatile blend of flute and guitar is well
    suited to a wide range of musical styles and periods, from Beethoven to
    the Beatles, from Medieval dances to today's favorite songs.
